#Qodehub's PHP-SDK for Slydepay.

## Documentation

Please find the [project documentation on the the official documentation website](http://qodehub.github.io/slydepay).

## Installation

This library requires PHP >=5.4.0 <=~7.1. I recommend using the latest available version of PHP as a matter of principle and report issues so for continious.

## Quality

To run the unit tests at the command line, issue `composer install` and then `phpunit` at the package root. This requires [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to be available as `composer`, and [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/manual/) to be available as `phpunit`.

This library attempts to comply with [PSR-1][], [PSR-2][], and [PSR-4][]. If you notice compliance oversights, please send a patch via pull request.
